# sipist-workspace

This repository provides containerized applications and microservices for the Information Processing and Retrieval Course @ Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico

This guide helps setting up a workspace environment for completing lab classes, which includes a search server and other auxiliary services.

Services provided include:

- [sipist/notebook](https://github.com/sipist/notebook) Jupyter Notebook Intelligent Retrieval Systems Stack

## Prerequisites

### Install Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop is an application for MacOS, Linux, and Windows machines for the building and sharing of containerized applications and microservices.

Install Docker Desktop on
[Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/),
[Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) or
[Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

### Install Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Install Git on
[Mac](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#install-git-on-mac)
[Windows](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#install-git-on-windows) or
[Linux](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#install-git-on-linux)

## Your first time launching the Workspace

1. Open Terminal.

2. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.

3. Run the following command to create your local clone

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sipist/sipist-workspace.git
   ```

   Press **Enter**

   ```bash
   Cloning into 'sipist-workspace'...
   remote: Enumerating objects: 297, done.
   remote: Counting objects: 100% (80/80), done.
   remote: Compressing objects: 100% (65/65), done.
   remote: Total 297 (delta 41), reused 38 (delta 14), pack-reused 217
   Receiving objects: 100% (297/297), 733.65 KiB | 501.00 KiB/s, done.
   Resolving deltas: 100% (136/136), done.
   ```

4. Change the current working directory to the location of the cloned directory.

   ```bash
   cd sipist-workspace/
   ```

5. From the cloned directory, start up `sipist-workspace` by running

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   _Note:_ The services are attached to this Terminal, so the logs for all the services provided will be printed on its window.
   Quitting this Terminal window quits all the services abruptly.
   To shutdown safely you will need to issue CTRL+C in the Terminal window and wait until all the services stop gracefuly.
   You can close the Terminal window after all services are stopped.

### Using the Jupyter Notebook [(Docs)](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/)

The Jupyter Notebook service runs on the non-stardard `10001` port. Token authentication is enabled.

1. You need to find your Authentication Token to login every time the `sipist-workspace` is launched (e.g., after a reboot)

2. Find the section of the logs towards the bottom of the Terminal window that look like this excerpt:

   ```log
   sipist-workspace-notebook-1  |     Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
   sipist-workspace-notebook-1  |         http://7fd8c38e99bd:10001/lab?token=f83ee982668ebe66bee2dbeb5875d14131a1d118d1e0fa12
   sipist-workspace-notebook-1  |         http://127.0.0.1:10001/lab?token=f83ee982668ebe66bee2dbeb5875d14131a1d118d1e0fa12
   ```

   _Note:_ You can also view the logs for the `sipist-workspace-notebook-1` in the Containers tab in the Docker Desktop application.

3. Follow the link printed last with host `127.0.0.1`. The authentication token is embedded in the URL.

## FAQ and Troubleshooting

### How do I update my workspace?

1. Firstly, from the project directory run

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

   This updates `sipist-workspace` to the latest version.

2. Secondly, from the project directory run

   ```bash
   docker compose pull
   ```

   This updates container images to the latest version.

3. Lastly, from the project directory run

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build --force-recreate --remove-orphans
   ```

   This starts up the `sipist-workspace` and cleans up unused images.

### I get Permission Errors and/or the notebook Save Button is disabled

You need to set the owner of every directory under `/home/jovyan/` to the user `jovyan` and groups `users`. This is the default username and group for the user in the notebook container.

You only need to run this once.

1. Open Terminal.

2. Run this to reset the permissions for files and folders under `home/jovyan/`.

   ```bash
   chown -R jovyan:users /home/jovyan/
   ```

If this still does not solve the issue with permissions then follow this recipe:

1. Open Terminal.

2. Run this do access the notebook container as administrator (root):

   ```bash
   docker compose exec -e GRANT_SUDO=yes --user root notebook /bin/bash
   ```

3. Run this to reset the permissions for files and folders under `home/jovyan/`.

   ```bash
   chown -R jovyan:users /home/jovyan/
   ```
